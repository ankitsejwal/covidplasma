### 🏥 Current Issue

- Thousands of 🧔🏽👩🏽 in growing economy with inadequate health infrastructre are left on there own to find convalescent plasma donors
- Currently there are thousands of numbers floating on the social media and whatsapp groups of kind people who are willing to donate plasma, this possesses privacy issues and many other challenges.

### ⛑ Workflow without covidplasma.world:

- Critical seeker is asked to arrange plasma
- Seeker posts request on various whatsapp groups and social media
- If lucky they get a message with a list of dozens of donors (most of the lists are outdated as some have already donated)
- Seeker calls each donor one by one to ask for blood group, location and whether they can donate
- This is repeated by many of their relatives to help find them a donor

### ⛑ Workflow with covidplasma.world:

- Critical seeker is asked to arrange plasma
- Seekers visits covidplasma.world and enter their details 📱
- Gets a call back from donor with the matching blood group 🙌🏼
